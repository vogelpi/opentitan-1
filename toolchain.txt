# Meson RISCV toolchain configuration.

# NOTE: If you're using a toolchain since version 20200602-1, it is likely that
#       you are using the meson toolchain configuration within the toolchain
#       install, rather than this file. This file remains mostly for legacy
#       reasons, and will eventually be removed.
